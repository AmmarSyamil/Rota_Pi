ROTA Pi, a steering wheel dedicated race sim made from Rasp Pico. It utalize all the peripheral including the throttle and braking on the wheel itself, so it could be used fully on the steering wheel, wihtout need extra pads for brake and accelerate.

It used rotary potensiometer for angle detection, with 2 linear magnetic hall sensor for accelerate and braking, alongside with multiple rotary encoder and button for other peripheral like gears ABS, DRS and other.




Background:

Lately, I really started into cars stuff and thats make me wanna play Car game, like F1 25, Asseto Corsa, or even Forza Horizon. But my money is already used for buying laptop (duhh) so i coulndt aford to buy dedicated race sim. Other than that, i also wanna make more portabel version, the one that doesnt require pads for accesibility (because thats the point of laptop right?). So because of that, I had an idea for this project.
